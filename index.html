            <h1>My Journey into Computer Science</h1>
            <p1>I started learning what programming what when I was 10 years old, my mum gifted me a book on how to Program in Java... 
                Needless to say I only started learning how to program in High school during the Covid lockdown when UNSW was running an online high school programming course (o7 HS1917).
                This dip into learning how to program drove me to take technology and programming courses from school which eventually led me to participate in the National Computer Science School 
                in the summer of 2022 and ultimately influenced my decision to study Computer Science at university today.
